# ðŸ“– Overview

Hi, Iâ€™m **Aleksa**.

Iâ€™ve been working as a **Minecraft Bedrock developer** for over five years and Iâ€™m currently finishing my **Computer Science degree**. I enjoy creating add-ons, custom worlds, and mechanics that feel polished and fun to play. I always try to keep my code **clean and organized**, push regular commits to **GitHub**, and use **Jira** to stay on top of tasks and projects.

## What Iâ€™m working on

Right now, Iâ€™m working with **Meraki Studios**. Before that, I contributed to teams like **Kubo Studios, Pickaxe Studios, The Craft Stars, and Piki Studios**. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ve built up skills in:

- Entities  
- Functions  
- Scripts  
- Particles  
- Sounds  
- Blockbench models and animations  

I also had the chance to be **lead developer at Pickaxe Studios**, which gave me valuable experience managing a small team and guiding projects from start to finish.

## Where it all started

I got my start with **Kubo Studios**, working from their very first map. Those early projects taught me a lot about Minecraft development, teamwork, and attention to detail â€” and laid the foundation for everything I do now.

## What Iâ€™ve learned

Some key lessons Iâ€™ve picked up over the years:

- Keep your code **clean and organized** â€” it saves headaches later.  
- **Communicate clearly** and track tasks so the whole team stays on the same page.  
- Donâ€™t be afraid to try new things â€” whether thatâ€™s scripting, modeling, or creating custom mechanics.  

I also enjoy sharing what I learn with others, whether through tutorials, helping teammates, or giving tips to other developers. Teaching is one of the best ways to solidify your own understanding.

## Looking ahead

Iâ€™m excited to continue building **interesting Minecraft experiences** and push the limits of what Bedrock add-ons and custom worlds can do. I want to keep learning, experimenting, and collaborating with other creators to make projects that are both **fun and polished**.
