## Minecraft Development

**What Iâ€™m good at these days:**

- **Add-ons & custom worlds** â€“ designing engaging gameplay experiences for Bedrock Edition.  
- **Scripting & functions** â€“ creating interactive mechanics, custom commands (including `/camera`), and gameplay logic.  
- **Entities** â€“ adding custom behaviors and interactions for mobs and NPCs.  
- **Particles & sounds** â€“ improving player experience with visual effects and audio cues.  
- **Custom structures & features** â€“ creating and placing dynamic structures, features, and world generation elements.  
- **Blockbench models & animations** â€“ creating and using custom models and animations when needed.  
- **Debugging & optimization** â€“ making sure add-ons run smoothly on different devices.  

## Project Management & Workflow

- **Version control** â€“ GitHub, with frequent commits and clean, organized repositories.  
- **Task management** â€“ Jira for tracking tasks, features, and bugs across projects.  
- **Team collaboration** â€“ experience working with multiple studios and small teams.  

## Technical Practices

- Writing clean, maintainable code thatâ€™s easy to update or expand.  
- Following structured workflows for multi-person projects.
