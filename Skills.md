## Minecraft Development
Iâ€™ve been developing **Minecraft Bedrock add-ons** and **custom worlds** for over five years.  
I focus on creating **interactive mechanics, entities, particles, sounds**, and sometimes **Blockbench models and animations** when needed.  
I also work with **custom structures, features, and commands** (including `/camera`).

## Workflow & Project Management
I always keep my **code clean and organized**, push regular commits to **GitHub**, and use **Jira** to manage tasks and projects.

## Studio Experience
Iâ€™ve worked with studios like **Meraki Studios, Kubo Studios, Pickaxe Studios, The Craft Stars, and Piki Studios**, gaining experience across multiple aspects of Minecraft development.  
I also had the chance to be **lead developer** at Pickaxe Studios, guiding projects and small teams.

## Learning & Collaboration
Iâ€™m passionate about **learning new features**, experimenting with **custom mechanics**, and **collaborating with other developers** to build polished, fun, and playable experiences.
