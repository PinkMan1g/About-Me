ðŸ“– Overview
Hi, Iâ€™m Aleksa.

Iâ€™ve been working as a Minecraft Bedrock developer for over five years and Iâ€™m currently finishing my Computer Science degree. I enjoy creating add-ons, custom worlds, and mechanics that feel polished and fun to play. I always try to keep my code clean and organized, push regular commits to GitHub, and use Jira to stay on top of tasks and projects.

What Iâ€™m working on
Right now, Iâ€™m working with Meraki Studios. Before that, I contributed to teams like Kubo Studios, Pickaxe Studios, The Craft Stars, and Piki Studios. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ve built up skills in entities, functions, scripts, particles, sounds, and even Blockbench models and animations. I also had the chance to be lead developer at Pickaxe Studios, which gave me some great experience managing a small team and guiding projects from start to finish.

Where it all started
I got my start with Kubo Studios, working from their very first map. Those early projects taught me a lot about Minecraft development, teamwork, and attention to detailâ€”and laid the foundation for everything I do now.

What Iâ€™ve learned
The most important lessons Iâ€™ve picked up are:

Keep your code clean and organizedâ€”it saves headaches later.

Communicate clearly and track tasks so the whole team stays on the same page.

Donâ€™t be afraid to try new thingsâ€”whether thatâ€™s scripting, modeling, or creating custom mechanics.

I also enjoy sharing what I learn with others, whether thatâ€™s through tutorials, helping teammates, or just giving tips to other developers. Teaching is a great way to solidify your own understanding.

Looking ahead
Iâ€™m excited to keep building interesting Minecraft experiences and to push the limits of what Bedrock add-ons and custom worlds can do. I want to keep learning, trying new ideas, and collaborating with other creators to make projects that are both fun and polished.

"Clean, organized, and creativeâ€”thatâ€™s how I like to build Minecraft worlds."
